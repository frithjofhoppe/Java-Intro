# Java Course

Developed at the [Swiss (IT) Education Center](https://www.epa.admin.ch/epa/de/home/dienstleistungen/ausbildungsangebot.html) from the [Federal Personal Office](https://www.epa.admin.ch/epa/de/home.html) in Bern, Switzerland.

## Description
This Java-Course should essentially give us practise in Java programming.     
We can also solidify our knowledge, we've already learnt (at the WISS, Bern).    
The duration of this course is one week, means 5 days full-time.

## What we've learnt
We could learn a lot in Java programming, mostly getting more and more practise.    
Although we've already learnt some things before, there were still some tricks and stuff we didn't know.    
     
Those were essentially:
------------------------
- Encapsulation (public, protected, {default}, private)
- Inheritance
- Interface - programming and using
- Packages
- Enums - programming and using them
- VarArgs (variable amount of parameters)
- Arrays - copy and clone them
- Collections - different collections (List, Set, Map)
- Assertions (Check if programm does as assumed)
- Exceptions - handling and throwing
- File I/O (Read/Write files)
- Streams (same as File I/O)
- Lambda expressions (functional programming)
- jUnit-Testing
- Miscellaneous (Random / Time & Date / Console / System Informations)    

Most things we practised by using them in some small exercises and them re-programm them in a bigger project,    
called "meteo".    
There we played with weather-forecasts and used Java-programming to autmatize the processes.
